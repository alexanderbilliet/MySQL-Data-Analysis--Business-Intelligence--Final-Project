# Advanced SQL: MySQL Data Analysis & Business Intelligence - Final Project

This repository contains the final project I did for the Udemy course "Advanced SQL: MySQL Data Analysis & Business Intelligence". Course link [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-sql-mysql-for-analytics-business-intelligence/)

The project consists of being an eCommerce Database Analyst for a fictional online retailer named Maven Fuzzy Factory. Several SQL queries are used to analyze and optimize marketing channels, measure and test website conversion performance, and use data to understand the impact of new product launches.
